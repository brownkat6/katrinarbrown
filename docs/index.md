        {{ "Hi! I'm Katrina, an undergraduate senior at Harvard University, where I'm obtaining an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Math, as well as a masters in Statistics. On campus, I conduct machine learning research at the Harvard Kempner Institute, where I'm interested in **fairness, robustness, and capabilities** of **language and multimodal foundation models**.

        I hail from the cornfields of Indiana, and since then I've [passed my time](/travel) living in Cambridge MA, NYC, and Chicago. In my spare moments, I love to urban hike the streets of NYC, road bike in Colorado, read Substack voraciously, and infuse baked goods and smoothies with vegetables. My creative side manifests in violin, which I studied seriously under Mimi Zweig at the IU Jacobs School of Music from 5-16 years old, and more sporadically since. I enjoy [teaching](/teaching), [speaking to crowds](/speaking), [working](/work) with interesting people, [taking hard courses](/courses), and [researching](/research) problems that are technical, challenging, and fun.

        Reach out to **katrinabrown [AT] college.harvard.edu** if you'd like to say hello!" | markdownify }}
