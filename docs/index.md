I'm an undergraduate senior at Harvard University, where I'm obtaining an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Math, as well as a masters in Statistics. On campus, I conduct machine learning research at the Harvard Kempner Institute, where I'm interested in fairness, robustness, and capabilities of language and multimodal foundation models.

I love to spend my spare moments urban hiking the streets of NYC, road biking in Colorado, voraciously reading Substack, infusing vegan baked goods with vegetables, and sampling every boba tea flavor I can get my hands on. I enjoy [teaching](teaching.md), [speaking to crowds](speaking.md), [working with interesting people](work.md), and [researching problems](research.md) that are technical, challenging, and fun.
