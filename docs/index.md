I'm an undergraduate senior at Harvard University, where I'm obtaining an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Math, as well as a masters in Statistics. On campus, I conduct machine learning research at the Harvard Kempner Institute, where I'm interested in **fairness, robustness, and capabilities** of **language and multimodal foundation models**.

I hail from the cornfields of Indiana, and since then I've passed my time living in Cambridge MA, NYC, and Chicago. I love to spend my spare moments urban hiking the streets of NYC, road biking in Colorado, voraciously reading Substack, infusing vegan baked goods with vegetables, and sampling every boba tea flavor available to tantalize the tastebuds. My artsy side manifests in violin, which I studied seriously at the IU Jacobs School of Music from 5-16 years old, and more sporadically ever since. I enjoy [teaching](teaching.md), [speaking to crowds](speaking.md), [working with interesting people](work.md), and [researching problems](research.md) that are technical, challenging, and fun.
