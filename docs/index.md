I'm an undergraduate senior at Harvard University, where I'm obtaining an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Math, as well as a masters in Statistics. On campus, I conduct machine learning research at the Harvard Kempner Institute, where I'm interested in **fairness, robustness, and capabilities** of **language and multimodal foundation models**.

I hail from the cornfields of Indiana, and since then I've passed my time living in Cambridge MA, NYC, and Chicago. In my spare moments, I love to urban hike the streets of NYC, road bike in Colorado, voraciously read Substack, and infuse baked goods and smoothies with vegetables. My artsy side manifests in violin, which I studied seriously under Mimi Zweig at the IU Jacobs School of Music from 5-16 years old, and more sporadically since. I enjoy [teaching](teaching.md), [speaking to crowds](speaking.md), [working with interesting people](work.md), [taking hard courses](courses.md), and [researching problems](research.md) that are technical, challenging, and fun.
