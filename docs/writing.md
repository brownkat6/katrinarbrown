### Debate
In high school, I was a 2x state champion in Public Forum Debate. I was awarded the [Bob Brittain Debate Scholarship](https://www.inspeechanddebate.org/recognition/scholarships) (2021), which is granted to the single top debater in Indiana each year, and I was featured in the [Herald Times](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14VMl5QaqvOlLlHkxkB4a2Fn4Xy9jzzQy/view) as the first student from my school to win state. 

Probe my thoughts on economic sanctions against Venezuela, China's Belt and Road Initiative, deep sea mining of rare earth elements, or anti-missile defense systems anytime!
