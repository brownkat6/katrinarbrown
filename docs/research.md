My research interests currently center on fairness, robustness, and capabilities of language and multimodal foundation models. 

I've been fortunate to be mentored by Finale Doshi-Velez at the Harvard Data to Actionable Knowledge (DtAK) Lab, Cynthia Dwork at the Harvard Kempner Institute, and Lionel Levine at the Cornell Long-term AI Safety Research (LAISR) lab.

I'm currently interested in inference time scheduling for reasoning models and the tradeoffs between reasoning and multi-agent debate.
