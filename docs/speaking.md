I appreciate the art of the written and spoken word in conveying information clearly. 

### Writing and Media
* I've opined on [invasive tech](https://harvardtechnologyreview.com/2024/11/01/ai-glasses-unveil-privacy-risks-an-interview-with-the-creators-of-i-xray/) and [cool startups](https://harvardtechnologyreview.com/2024/12/17/from-dorm-room-to-boardroom-how-ron-nachum-and-sapien-are-redefining-ai-in-corporate-finance/) for the Harvard Tech Review, and discussed [the future of women in STEM](https://www.magbloom.com/2020/04/for-the-love-of-stem-a-conversation-about-the-future-of-women-in-technology/) with Bloom Magazine. 
* I conducted research with US Cyber Command to [analyze CCP Propaganda](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12VHdBQsu-iHl5Fe853OpN78hiKPkt_NG/view?usp=sharing). 
* I've also reflected publicly on one of my past internship experiences, which you can view [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feeIwfM_vVs). 

### Debate
In high school, I was a 2x state champion and 3x national qualifier in Public Forum Debate and Questions Debate. I was awarded the [Bob Brittain Debate Scholarship](https://www.inspeechanddebate.org/recognition/scholarships) (2021), which is granted to the single top debater in Indiana each year, and I was featured in the [Herald Times](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14VMl5QaqvOlLlHkxkB4a2Fn4Xy9jzzQy/view) as the first student from my school to win state. 

Probe my thoughts on economic sanctions against Venezuela, China's Belt and Road Initiative, deep sea mining of rare earth elements, or anti-missile defense systems anytime!
