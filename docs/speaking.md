I adhere to the necessity of the written and spoken word to convey information, spanning anything from technical intracacies to geopolitical dynamics, both concisely and clearly. 

In high school, I was a [2x state champion](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14VMl5QaqvOlLlHkxkB4a2Fn4Xy9jzzQy/view) and 3x national qualifier in Public Forum Debate. I was awarded the Bob Brittain Debate Scholarship (2021), which is granted to the single top debater in Indiana each year.  

I've written about [invasive technology](https://harvardtechnologyreview.com/2024/11/01/ai-glasses-unveil-privacy-risks-an-interview-with-the-creators-of-i-xray/) and [cool startups](https://harvardtechnologyreview.com/2024/12/17/from-dorm-room-to-boardroom-how-ron-nachum-and-sapien-are-redefining-ai-in-corporate-finance/) for the Harvard Tech Review. I had a brief stint at the Harvard Foreign Policy Initiative (2021), where I led a team of student researchers collaborating with US Cyber Command to [analyze CCP Propaganda](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12VHdBQsu-iHl5Fe853OpN78hiKPkt_NG/view?usp=sharing). I've also reflected publicly on my past internship experiences, which you can view [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feeIwfM_vVs).
