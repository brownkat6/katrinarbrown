My professional experience spans software engineering, systems programming, quantitative trading, quantitative research, and ML Research Engineering across startups, Big Tech, and prop trading firms. 

From May 2020-July 2021, I worked at [The Bee Corp](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-bee-corp) as an ML Research Engineering Intern, where I trained MaskRCNN and DANN models on proprietary data. 
In Summer 2022, I interned at [Meta](https://www.meta.com/) as a software engineer, where I developed a full-stack tool to aggregate Instagram Integrity metrics using Hack PHP, React JS, Lua, and SQL. In Fall 2021, I worked as a software engineer with the UN Capital Development Fund to develop a web portal for peer market comparison as part of Harvard's [Tech For Social Good](https://socialgood.hcs.harvard.edu/) initiative. During Summer 2023, I was a Core Development (systems programming) intern at [Hudson River Trading](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/) (HRT), and during Summer 2024 I returned to HRT as an Algorithm Development (Quantitative Research) intern. During Spring 2024, I interned at [Jump Trading](https://www.jumptrading.com/) for quantitative research, and during Winter 2024, I also interned at [Five Rings](https://fiverings.com/) for quantitative trading.
