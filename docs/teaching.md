### Teaching Fellow

In Fall 2023, I was the Head Teaching Fellow for [CS 121](https://cs121.boazbarak.org/syllabus/), our advanced theoretical computer science class with ~120 students. I've also TF'd [Stat 110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home), our undergrad probability course, twice, as well as [CS 120](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/class/cs120-intro-algorithms-and-their-limitations), our introductory algorithms course, and [CS 124](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rji0U07-zhpOa_-ywt0ruELNUz_r-wdT_2tlELduuVo/edit?gid=0#gid=0), our data structures and algorithms course, working with professors Boaz Barak, Joe Blitzstein, Madhu Sudan, and Adam Hesterberg.

As a 5-time teaching fellow, I run 75 minute weekly sections (additional lectures reinforcing course material), grade assignments and exams, develop course material, and hold weekly office hours.

### Outreach

As a board member for [Harvard Undergraduate Women in Computer Science](https://www.huwics.com/) (2022-2024), I oversaw a 15K budget to run a mentorships program connecting 200 under and upper classmen, and ran ~10 educational events for the Careers team attracting between 10-100 students each. I also helped run [WeCode](https://www.wecodeconference.com/), the world's largest student-run undergraduate women in tech conference!

As a mentor for [Veritas AI](https://www.veritasai.com/ai-scholars) (2022), I taught four cohorts of AI Scholars (100+ students) the fundamentals of ML, linear/logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, etc in a 10-week program.

I had the privilege of serving as an afterschool mentor (2017-2021) to middle and high school students in Speech & Debate. During this time, I developed a new "[Middle School Debate](https://www.speechwire.com/files/15260-23-24INDIANAMSEVENTRULES.pdf)" event and instructional resources for debaters, coaches, and judges, all of which were adopted by the Indiana High School Forensics Association (IHSFA), introduced to several hundred Indiana middle-school students, and continue to run today.

I also led a 4-person team at [IndianaComputes!](https://indianacomputes.net/) (2021), an Indiana University initiative funded by the Department of Education, to pilot Indiana's first K-12 data science curriculum and distribute this material across 4 elementary schools in Indiana. For this outreach and other technical achievements, I received the [NCWIT Regional Award](https://ncwit.org/program/aspirations-in-computing/aic-recognitions/) as well as the [IAG Scholarship](https://www.iag-online.org/Scholarships/) (which is awarded to the top 2 students academically and extracurricularly in Indaiana each year).
