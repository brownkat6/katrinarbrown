### Teaching Courses

In Fall 2023, I was the Head Teaching Fellow for [CS 121](https://cs121.boazbarak.org/syllabus/), our advanced theoretical computer science class with ~120 students. I've also TF'd [Stat 110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home), our undergrad probability course, twice, as well as [CS 120](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/class/cs120-intro-algorithms-and-their-limitations), our introductory algorithms course, and [CS 124](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rji0U07-zhpOa_-ywt0ruELNUz_r-wdT_2tlELduuVo/edit?gid=0#gid=0), our data structures and algorithms course, working with professors Boaz Barak, Joe Blitzstein, Madhu Sudan, and Adam Hesterberg.

As a teaching fellow, I ran 75 minute weekly sections (additional lectures reinforcing course material), graded assignments and exams, wrote course materials, and held weekly office hours.

As a mentor for [Veritas AI](https://www.veritasai.com/ai-scholars) (2022), I taught four cohorts of AI Scholars (100+ students) across 50 instructional hours the fundamentals of ML topics including linear/logistic regression, SVMs, and XGBoost models.

### Developing Educational Programs

I mentored middle and high school students afterschool in Speech & Debate (2017-2021). During this time, I developed a new "[Middle School Debate](https://www.speechwire.com/files/15260-23-24INDIANAMSEVENTRULES.pdf)" event and instructional resources for debaters, coaches, and judges, all of which were adopted by the Indiana High School Forensics Association (IHSFA), introduced to several hundred Indiana middle-school students, and continue to run today.

I also led a 4-person team at [IndianaComputes!](https://indianacomputes.net/) (2021), an Indiana University initiative funded by the Department of Education, to pilot Indiana's first K-12 data science curriculum and distribute this material across 4 secondary schools in Indiana.
