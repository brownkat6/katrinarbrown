* [Main-Memory Optimized Column-Store Database](https://code.harvard.edu/kab1621/cs165-project): Design a database supporting B-trees for clustered or secondary indexes, fast scans utilizing CPU prefetching and multi-cores, scan sharing, and the abilitiy to complete select-project-join queries at least an order of magnitude faster than traditional row-store database systems in analytical workloads. Written in C. A technical writeup documenting and analyzing the performance of the system can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OiQS08d9cdviQxiH7I3DbZmD7R-Wcc0qah9GHuDx9KM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.kd6yjkcfy9e). 
* [Secure Online Voting System](https://code.harvard.edu/kab1621/cs262-final-project-voting): Secure, scalable distributed voting system featuring user authentication, ballot submission, and realâ€‘time vote tallying.
* [Detecting Steering Vectors in Large Language Models](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AT1IJtR4GeaD9MDr2kl_CQad_av0xce0/view?usp=sharing): Analyzed whether large language models can detect a steering vector applied early in the context, and the application of these vectors towards eliciting jailbreaks. 
* [Debatetrade](https://github.com/brownkat6/debate-trade): Web platform to facilitate exchange of research arguments on the high school debate circuit, with a userbase of 100+ members.
